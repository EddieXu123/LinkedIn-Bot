# LinkedIn-Bot
Number 4 of 10
\
I was scrolling through my LinkedIn feed, reading tons of posts about people losing their summer internships due to COVID-19. Fortunately, many kind recruiters reached out to these people and helped them land a different remote internship. These recruiters were already working extremely hard behind the scenes, so I knew I wanted to acknowledge them in some way and to spread general positivity during these times. As a result, I built a LinkedIn bot that would log on to my LinkedIn profile, post a positive message, and like as many posts in my feed as I could (or up to a certain number--which can be changed in the code).

Then, the bot would search up a list of a certain company's recruiters (the company can be anything you want), and send each person a cheerful invite/note to thank them for their work (the bot could send this note to either someone you can connect with OR someone you can message directly). The letter was actually pretty short letter, and only a few recruiters were actually accepting connection requests/messages, but many of the ones who did replied with thanks, making the whole experience worth it!
